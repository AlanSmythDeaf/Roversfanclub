## UX
When i decided to set up the Rovers Fan Club, the aim was to have simple website about the Shamrock Rovers Fan Club to start off, the website is intend really for anyone who wants to be a Rovers Fan Club, providing information, news about the team also the fan club. Pretty much like a social club gathering, bringing people together. Also giving brief information about Rovers and what it looks like being a Rovers Fan using the roll of honour and gallery pages.

### Colour Scheme
The three main colours that i decided to used are Green #118528, white #ffffff and black #000000

Those colours green and white is the Shamrock Rovers badge colour. So I want to stick with that theme 
With the white background, I went with black font. The reason I chose those colour as it’s easier to see the contrast

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text.
- `#118528 ` used for contact page ‘Supporter Club’ text.

I use the website call coolors.co to get the color palette
