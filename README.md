## UX
Briefly explain your design processes.

### Colour Scheme

The three main colours used are Green #118528, white #ffffff and black #000000

Those colours green and white is the Shamrock Rovers badge colour. So I want to stick with that theme 
With the white background, I went with black font. The reason I chose those colour as it’s easier to see the contrast

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text.
- `#118528 ` used for contact page ‘Supporter Club’ text.

I use the website call coolors.co to get the color palette
